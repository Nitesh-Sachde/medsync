# üè• MedSync Core Focus Reorganization

## Overview
The MedSync application has been reorganized to focus on core hospital management functionality due to time constraints. Non-essential modules have been moved to the `unused-modules` folder for future reintegration.

## üéØ Core Focus Areas

### Active Modules

2. **Admin Dashboard** - Streamlined staff management (department functionality removed)
3. **Doctor Dashboard** - Patient care, appointments, and prescription management
4. **Patient Dashboard** - Personal health management and appointment booking
5. **Appointment System** - Complete booking, scheduling, and management
6. **AI Health Assistant** - Integrated across all active dashboards
7. **Authentication System** - Complete user management and role-based access

### Supported User Roles

## üîÑ Reintegration Process

To restore removed modules when time permits:

1. **Move files back to original locations**
   ```bash
   # Example for pharmacy module
   move unused-modules/frontend/pages/PharmacyDashboard.tsx src/pages/
   move unused-modules/backend/models/Inventory.js backend/models/
   move unused-modules/backend/routes/inventory.js backend/routes/
   move unused-modules/backend/controllers/inventoryController.js backend/controllers/
   ```

2. **Update backend server.js**
   - Restore model imports
   - Restore route registrations

3. **Update frontend App.tsx**
   - Restore component imports
   - Restore route definitions

4. **Update DashboardRedirect.tsx**
   - Restore role routing logic

5. **Update authentication flows**
   - Restore role navigation in Login.tsx and Register.tsx

6. **Restore full AdminDashboard**
   - Replace simplified version with AdminDashboard_full.tsx
   - Restore department management API calls

## üéØ Benefits of Current State

### Development Focus
- ‚úÖ Reduced complexity during development phase
- ‚úÖ Faster testing and debugging cycles
- ‚úÖ Cleaner codebase for core functionality
- ‚úÖ Stable deployment preparation

### User Experience
